# Aedificium
A mod for Cities: Skylines

See https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=793489846

This mod looks for new workshop subscriptions to buildings, intersections, props and trees 
and loads them on the fly for instant use. 

*YES*, that means you can *SUBSCRIBE* to something from the workshop and *USE* it *instantaniously*!

The mod is compatible with RICO - buildings. It also integrates with the new phantastic FindIt mod.

Note that this mod is beta. Bugs are likely. 


# How it works 

There's nothing much to do for you really. Once you subscribe to an asset - either via your real browser or the built in Steam one, it will take a few seconds until your Steam client finishes the download. 

Once that happens, a Chirper message will notify you of the new subscription and the games panels will be updated. 

Plop the new asset as ususal. You can also click on the icon in the chirper message.

# Youtubers and Streamers

If you happen to feature the mod in your videos / streams, please let me know.

# Beggars corner

If you like what I am doing and want to support my work and my little family, please have a look at my 
Amazon Wishlist ( https://smile.amazon.de/gp/registry/wishlist/2QEY9IZX4HEIC ) or paypal me ( https://www.paypal.me/TailgunnerOnSkylines ).

Also, I am sitting here still on the standard game with no DLC. I have another fine mod in the pipeline, but I can only partially test it, since I'd need the DLCs for that. ( Did disasters introduce new services btw?)
So if somebody has a leftover gift code, I'd be grateful.

# Known Issues

When you hotload an asset some textures of some small rocks go totally bonanza and are replaces by textures from the loaded asset; But only when viewed from above a certain height. That may or may not disturb you depending on the colors of the loaded asset and the level of your OCD. 
Maybe I can fix this over the weekend. But I figure I put this out there already since the issue is a minor one.

# Caveats 

Other mods not using the PrefabCollection directly but by keeping a local copy will probaly not reflect hotloaded buildings (Like for instance the Building Search mod, use FindIt instead ) 


# What's the name 

It's latin for "building". Consider it a working title. I'll probably go for something better like "Impromptu" or "Hotload" when this gets out of beta. 


# Thank You's. 

Many thanks to thale5 for giving me a starting point with his Loading Screen Mod.
